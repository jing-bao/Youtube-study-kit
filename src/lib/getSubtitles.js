period","offset":53},{"text":"of very great change.","offset":61},{"text":"And that&amp;#39;s for xxx unusual.","offset":63},{"text":"For instance, if you compare\nit to the previous 40 years","offset":68},{"text":"in most of the advanced\ncapitalist democracies,","offset":71},{"text":"they were a period of relative stability","offset":75},{"text":"after World War

of\nEurope were being rebuilt","offset":87},{"text":"with Marshal Plan aid and it was a period,","offset":91},{"text":"partly for demographic reasons,","offset":95},{"text":"of very great political stability","offset":97},{"text":"for people who grew up in that period.","offset":100},{"text":"Internationally, as well, it was a period","offset":103},{"text":"of very great stability because partly,","offset":106},{"text":"because of the Cold War.","offset":113},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s true we had episodes\nlike the Cuban Missile Crisis","offset":114},{"text":"and the Vietnam War but as\nthe Vietnam War indicates,","offset":118},{"text":"most of the conflicts within the Cold War","offset":123},{"text":"were played out as you like, as proxy wars","offset":126},{"text":"in other

our minds","offset":179},{"text":"as like it was yesterday.","offset":182},{"text":"We experienced them in real time","offset":185},{"text":"but there are many people in this

or the 60 years","offset":200},{"text":"after World War II, it&amp;#39;s all history.","offset":205},{"text":"One of the first things I need to do","offset":209},{"text":"and I&amp;#39;m gonna try and make\nthis a regular practice","offset":212},{"text":"during the course is I\nneed to take everybody back","offset":215},{"text":"and to make people\nunderstand who weren&amp;#39;t there","offset":219},{"text":"what it was like and then to remind people","offset":223},{"text":"who&amp;#39;ve lived through it of things","offset":226},{"text":"that they might have forgotten.","offset":229},{"text":"So let&amp;#39;s just go back to 1989 in Berlin.","offset":231},{"text":"- The Berlin Wall, once\nit divided East from West,","offset":237},{"text":"now on its way

Wall.","offset":264},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s impossible to completely describe","offset":267},{"text":"how deeply Germans feel\nabout what&amp;#39;s happened here.","offset":269},{"text":"East German border guards tonight","offset":274},{"text":"were literally tearing down\nportions of the wall itself,","offset":276},{"text":"not the whole wall but\nportions of the wall","offset":279},{"text":"to make it easier for East\nGermans to come into West Berlin","offset":281},{"text":"and as the joyous hordes of Berliners","offset":285},{"text":"were still streaming through the wall,","offset":288},{"text":"the East German communist government said","offset":290},{"text":"they can come and go permanently,","offset":292},{"text":"they can come into West\nBerlin, have a look","offset":294},{"text":"and then come back home again","offset":296},{"text":"with no special documents required.","offset":298},{"text":"Today, what goes through\nyour mind and heart?","offset":300},{"text":"- Well, of course, I look\nback to all those years","offset":303},{"text":"of hardship for the\nfamilies even more than","offset":306},{"text":"for the country as a whole and it&amp;#39;s moving","offset":310},{"text":"to see families getting together again.","offset":313},{"text":"My feeling is that we are very close","offset":316},{"text":"to an end of the artificial\ndivision of Berlin","offset":319},{"text":"and I also believe we\nare close to the point","offset":322},{"text":"where the parts of Germany will\nbecome much closer together.","offset":324},{"text":"This, of course,","offset":330},{"text":"only within the reasonable\nEuropean framework.","offset":331},{"text":"Anyone know who that was?","offset":336},{"text":"Xxx Billy Braun, the former\nChancellor of Germany","offset":339},{"text":"who actually would die a couple of years,","offset":341},{"text":"three years after that,","offset":344},{"text":"so he was one of the\ncelebratory crowd at that time.","offset":346},{"text":"So that might give you a\nlittle sense of the shock","offset":351},{"text":"and the enthusiasm that people experienced","offset":355},{"text":"in the latter days of 1989.","offset":359},{"text":"This had been a period\nin which the Soviet Union","offset":364},{"text":"was clearly losing its\ngrip on Eastern Europe.","offset":367},{"text":"It wasn&amp;#39;t just Germany.","offset":371},{"text":"Right across Eastern\nEurope, all through 1989,","offset":374},{"text":"there had been these massive\nresistance movements developing","offset":379},{"text":"and the Soviet Union was losing,","offset":383},{"text":"it was clearly not in\na position to intervene","offset":386},{"text":"in these countries.","offset":390},{"text":"And they were shedding\ntotalitarian control","offset":391},{"text":"for the first time in decades.","offset":397},{"text":"Of course, the great exception","offset":402},{"text":"which we will be talking\nabout next week was in China","offset":403},{"text":"where demonstrations in Tiananmen Square","offset":407},{"text":"that June had come out,\nmeant a very different result","offset":413},{"text":"but in most of the world, after 1989,","offset":417},{"text":"it seemed like democracy was on the March.","offset":420},{"text":"We saw the democratization of all","offset":425},{"text":"of the former Soviet Union bloc\ncountries in Eastern Europe","offset":429},{"text":"even places like South\nAfrica which had been mired","offset":436},{"text":"in a bitter conflict for\ndecades transitioned in","offset":442},{"text":"the early 1990s to a\nmulti-racial democracy.","offset":447},{"text":"The problems in Northern\nIreland finally settled","offset":453},{"text":"with the Good Friday Accords in 1997.","offset":456},{"text":"Even Israel-Palestine which had been one","offset":461},{"text":"of the most intractable\nconflicts for decades and decades","offset":465},{"text":"seemed to be moving towards a\nresolution in the early 1990s.","offset":473},{"text":"There were the Oslo Accords, the PLO","offset":478},{"text":"and the Israeli government\nwere negotiating a settlement.","offset":481},{"text":"Anyone who was in Israel or the West Bank","offset":485},{"text":"at that time anticipated\nthat there was going","offset":488},{"text":"to be a settlement until the assassination","offset":491},{"text":"of one of the key\nprotagonists, Yitzhak Rabin","offset":495},{"text":"in November of 1995.","offset":498},{"text":"And that would lead to an unraveling","offset":501},{"text":"of that potential settlement\nbut in the early 1990s,","offset":505},{"text":"it&amp;#39;s really I think difficult to overstate","offset":509},{"text":"the enthusiasm for change.","offset":513},{"text":"This is the period when Francis Fukuyama","offset":515},{"text":"was talking about the end of history","offset":518},{"text":"by which he meant that liberal democracy","offset":521},{"text":"was sweeping the world.","offset":524},{"text":"In fact, at the turn of the 21st century,","offset":526},{"text":"we finally went from a world\nin which most countries","offset":529},{"text":"in the world were not democracies\nby most standard measures","offset":534},{"text":"to a world in which most\ncountries were democracies","offset":537},{"text":"by most standard measures.","offset":541},{"text":"So it&amp;#39;s not surprising that\none would have had the kind","offset":544},{"text":"of enthusiasm that\nFukuyama had at that time","offset":549},{"text":"and that was almost,","offset":552},{"text":"what&amp;#39;s the word?","offset":560},{"text":"Just snowballing across so\nmuch of the developed world.","offset":561},{"text":"Enormous confidence in\ndemocratic capitalism","offset":565},{"text":"and enormous confidence in the idea","offset":569},{"text":"that many people were gonna\nbe lifted out of poverty","offset":571},{"text":"and that the world was heading","offset":575},{"text":"for a kind of benign equilibrium,","offset":577},{"text":"as an economist would say,\nFukuyama&amp;#39;s end of history idea.","offset":582},{"text":"now let&amp;#39;s fast-forward three decades","offset":590},{"text":"and let&amp;#39;s stay in Germany and\nhere&amp;#39;s a very different thing","offset":592},{"text":"to look at.","offset":599},{"text":"(speaking in foreign language)","offset":606},{"text":"(audience cheering)","offset":608},{"text":"(speaking in foreign language)","offset":611},{"text":"So he&amp;#39;s a leader of the\nAlternative for Deutschland,","offset":654},{"text":"far-right anti-immigrant,","offset":658},{"text":"anti-system political party\nand what he is celebrating","offset":660},{"text":"is that they have\ncrossed the 5% threshold.","offset":665},{"text":"This is the AFP here on this graph.","offset":670},{"text":"Germany has a 5% threshold to get seated","offset":673},{"text":"in the parliament so if you\ndon&amp;#39;t get 5%, you get no seats,","offset":676},{"text":"they hadn&amp;#39;t gotten 5% before\nand now they had won 5%","offset":680},{"text":"and so they saw themselves\nas getting a foothold","offset":686},{"text":"in German electoral\npolitics for the first time.","offset":689},{"text":"Germany, in 2017 was\ncoming out of a situation","offset":695},{"text":"in which there had been a grand coalition","offset":701},{"text":"between the SPD which is the left","offset":704},{"text":"of said Social Democratic Party\nand the right of center CDU,","offset":707},{"text":"Christian Democratic Party\nled by Angela Merkel.","offset":713},{"text":"And the SPD were very unhappy,","offset":717},{"text":"they had been in this grand\ncoalition for a long time","offset":722},{"text":"and they found that they\nwere paying a huge price","offset":725},{"text":"with their supporters.","offset":727},{"text":"They were getting less\nand less of the vote","offset":729},{"text":"for reasons we&amp;#39;ll talk\nabout later in the course","offset":730},{"text":"and they announced that they\nwere not gonna participate","offset":734},{"text":"in a grand coalition again\nand they were gonna go","offset":737},{"text":"into opposition and rebuild themselves.","offset":741},{"text":"Angela Merkel then spent\nthe next six months,","offset":745},{"text":"Alternative for Deutschland were and still","offset":750},{"text":"are seen as beyond the pale,","offset":753},{"text":"nobody will form a government with them.","offset":756},{"text":"So she spent the next six months trying","offset":760},{"text":"to put together a coalition","offset":762},{"text":"with the Green Environmentalist Party","offset":764},{"text":"and the so-called Free Democrats.","offset":767},{"text":"The Free Democrats would be\nwhat we would think of as,","offset":769},{"text":"in this country, as\nRand Paul libertarians.","offset":773},{"text":"They are for small\ngovernment, low regulation","offset":776},{"text":"across the board.","offset":780},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s not surprising\nthat she couldn&amp;#39;t do it","offset":782},{"text":"because the greens want green regulation.","offset":788},{"text":"They want environmental regulation.","offset":791},{"text":"That&amp;#39;s their raison d&amp;#39;etre\nand the Free Democrats","offset":792},{"text":"want no regulation or\ncertainly, less regulation.","offset":795},{"text":"So they stumbled along in\nand out of negotiations","offset":798},{"text":"but they weren&amp;#39;t able to form a coalition.","offset":804},{"text":"However, over the course\nof that six months,","offset":808},{"text":"all the opinion polls showed that the AFD,","offset":812},{"text":"the Alternative for Deutschland","offset":817},{"text":"was actually rising in popularity.","offset":819},{"text":"And so the German\npresident was very against","offset":821},{"text":"having another election in\nthe face of the stalemate","offset":826},{"text":"with the Social Democrats refusing","offset":830},{"text":"to join in a grand\ncoalition on the one hand","offset":833},{"text":"and Merkel&amp;#39;s inability to construct","offset":836},{"text":"a different coalition on the other.","offset":838},{"text":"They all knew that if they\nwent for another election,","offset":841},{"text":"the AFD would do even better.","offset":844},{"text":"So finally, after much hand-wringing,","offset":848},{"text":"the SPD was persuaded after extracting","offset":851},{"text":"a very big set of concessions,\nincluding six ministries","offset":857},{"text":"and the Finance Ministry.","offset":863},{"text":"They were persuaded to go\nback into a grand coalition","offset":864},{"text":"even though a lot of their\nmembership didn&amp;#39;t want it.","offset":868},{"text":"So terrified were they of the\nprospect of another election","offset":871},{"text":"in which the far right\nwould do even better.","offset":875},{"text":"So we thought German politics\nwas kind of settling down","offset":881},{"text":"at this point but the following year,","offset":884},{"text":"this is what you see happening.","offset":888},{"text":"- [Presnter] German\nChancellor, Angela Merkel,","offset":890},{"text":"who&amp;#39;s led Germany for 13\nyears has offered to step down","offset":892},{"text":"as her party&amp;#39;s leader\nand said she won&amp;#39;t run","offset":895},{"text":"for office again after\nher term ends in 2021.","offset":898},{"text":"Her announcement came\na day after her party,","offset":902},{"text":"the Christian Democratic Union,","offset":904},{"text":"saw a disappointing performance\nin a key regional election","offset":906},{"text":"in the state of Hesse.","offset":910},{"text":"The far-right, Alternative\nfor Germany party","offset":911},{"text":"claimed more than a dozen\nseats in Hesse&amp;#39;s Parliament","offset":914},{"text":"for the first time.","offset":916},{"text":"The entire migrant\nparty now controls seats","offset":917},{"text":"in all 16 of Germany&amp;#39;s state Parliament&amp;#39;s","offset":919},{"text":"plus the National Bundestag\nand European Parliament.","offset":923},{"text":"- So there it is.","offset":927},{"text":"They had also done very poorly","offset":928},{"text":"in the Bavarian regional elections.","offset":930},{"text":"They had hemorrhaged about\n10% of their vote to the AFD","offset":933},{"text":"in these regional\nelections and by the way,","offset":937},{"text":"the SPD wasn&amp;#39;t very happy either","offset":940},{"text":"because they were hemorrhaging\nsupport to the greens.","offset":942},{"text":"And this is something\nwe&amp;#39;ll see playing out","offset":948},{"text":"in many European countries.","offset":950},{"text":"The establishment parties are\nshrinking and becoming weaker","offset":952},{"text":"and the parties on the fringes are growing","offset":956},{"text":"and becoming stronger.","offset":959},{"text":"And it was impossible\nnot to start thinking","offset":961},{"text":"about the past and thinking particularly","offset":964},{"text":"about the 1920s and 30s.","offset":967},{"text":"(speaking in foreign language)","offset":971},{"text":"- [Presenter] As a result of\nthe elections of July, 1932,","offset":993},{"text":"the Nazis became the\nbiggest party in Germany","offset":996},{"text":"with 37% of the vote.","offset":998},{"text":"- So if you wanna go back to the 1930s,","offset":1003},{"text":"you can see that that video was\nabout the July 1932 election","offset":1006},{"text":"and you can see what happened\nin the subsequent elections","offset":1012},{"text":"that it was a very unstable system.","offset":1017},{"text":"They were having multiple\nelections and of course,","offset":1018},{"text":"18 months later, Hitler came to power.","offset":1023},{"text":"And if you go to Germany,","offset":1027},{"text":"you hear very anxious people talking about","offset":1030},{"text":"is this back to the future?","offset":1034},{"text":"Is 2017 and 2018 some kind\nof replay of the empowerment","offset":1036},{"text":"of extremist parties and of course,","offset":1043},{"text":"it wasn&amp;#39;t just Germany.","offset":1048},{"text":"In 2016 we had massive shocks delivered","offset":1050},{"text":"to establishment parties\nwith the Brexit result","offset":1054},{"text":"in the UK and Donald\nTrump&amp;#39;s populist stampede","offset":1057},{"text":"to the presidency in the US,","offset":1062},{"text":"both widely unanticipated outcomes by most","offset":1064},{"text":"of the establishment parties,\npundits and politicians.","offset":1069},{"text":"And you could go around the world.","offset":1074},{"text":"In the Austrian elections of 2016,","offset":1075},{"text":"people are very relieved\nthat in the runoff,","offset":1078},{"text":"the Green candidate actually\ndefeated the far-right","offset":1081},{"text":"quite handsomely by 54 to 46%","offset":1086},{"text":"but if you look at the legislature,","offset":1090},{"text":"again, you see the\nfar-right gaining ground,","offset":1092},{"text":"the establishment parties\ncoming in fourth and fifth","offset":1095},{"text":"in the 2017 legislative elections.","offset":1099},{"text":"These are the parties that would normally","offset":1102},{"text":"have come in first and second","offset":1104},{"text":"while the far-right\nparty increased its vote,","offset":1107},{"text":"putting them a close third with 51 seats,","offset":1112},{"text":"while the Greens fell below\nthe threshold and won nothing","offset":1115},{"text":"or if you look at Belgium,\nyou see a center-right party","offset":1120},{"text":"retains its majority but if\nyou drill down a little bit,","offset":1127},{"text":"you can see that there\nwas an increase of support","offset":1131},{"text":"for the far-right Flemish Vlaams Belang","offset":1134},{"text":"which received almost 12%\nof the vote gaining seats.","offset":1136},{"text":"If you look at Italy, you can see","offset":1142},{"text":"the center-left party ceding\npower to the center-right","offset":1144},{"text":"but many of the votes for\nthe center-right party","offset":1150},{"text":"are coming from the league, so-called,","offset":1153},{"text":"again, a far right-wing populist party","offset":1156},{"text":"which ends up with 125 seats","offset":1159},{"text":"and 17% of the popular vote, of 109 seats","offset":1163},{"text":"and I could put up another\nseven or eight or nine slides","offset":1171},{"text":"of different countries that\nbasically tell the same stories","offset":1174},{"text":"in country after country across Europe","offset":1179},{"text":"both Eastern Europe and Western Europe,","offset":1182},{"text":"including countries that\nwe thought of as bastions","offset":1185},{"text":"of civil social democratic\nstability like Sweden.","offset":1188},{"text":"You see these far-right\nparties doing well,","offset":1192},{"text":"Turkey, Latin America, elsewhere,","offset":1195},{"text":"where anti-establishment\nparties that sometimes","offset":1198},{"text":"also verge on being anti-system parties","offset":1201},{"text":"are gaining ground in many legislatures.","offset":1206},{"text":"So if you think about the contrast","offset":1211},{"text":"between the videos of\n1989 and where the world","offset":1213},{"text":"has been since 2016, it\ncouldn&amp;#39;t be more dramatic","offset":1218},{"text":"and in some ways, it&amp;#39;s a big downer","offset":1223},{"text":"but my first thing I wanna say\nis don&amp;#39;t get too depressed.","offset":1228},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s not all of course, for depression.","offset":1233},{"text":"The central questions of\nthis course are three.","offset":1239},{"text":"How did we get from there to here?","offset":1243},{"text":"What are the challenges and\nprospects going forward?","offset":1247},{"text":"And most importantly, in\nthe last part of the course,","offset":1251},{"text":"how could we get to a better place","offset":1255},{"text":"in many of the countries\nthat we&amp;#39;re talking about?","offset":1258},{"text":"We&amp;#39;ll spend a lot of time on the US","offset":1261},{"text":"but not exclusively in the US.","offset":1263},{"text":"I should say a little bit\nabout the distinctive approach","offset":1268},{"text":"that I&amp;#39;m gonna be taking\nin these lectures,","offset":1271},{"text":"not to say it&amp;#39;s the best approach;","offset":1276},{"text":"there are many ways to look\nat this kind of material","offset":1277},{"text":"but it is the approach\nthat I&amp;#39;m going to be using.","offset":1280},{"text":"And the first thing I would\nsay about this approach","offset":1285},{"text":"is that I&amp;#39;m going to be studying history","offset":1288},{"text":"with the tools of political science","offset":1291},{"text":"and political theory on the one hand","offset":1293},{"text":"but also using history\nto keep political science","offset":1296},{"text":"and political theory honest.","offset":1301},{"text":"So what do I mean by that?","offset":1305},{"text":"Well, one thing that is remarkable\nabout the events of 1989","offset":1307},{"text":"is that they supply us with\na terrific natural experiment","offset":1316},{"text":"from the point of view\nof social scientists.","offset":1321},{"text":"If you look at the\nliterature, for example,","offset":1324},{"text":"of people who studied\nEuropean democracies,","offset":1326},{"text":"before 1989, they were essentially\ncycling endless numbers","offset":1331},{"text":"of theories through the same old data set","offset":1335},{"text":"that everybody had had for four decades.","offset":1337},{"text":"And they didn&amp;#39;t have any\na big exogenous change.","offset":1341},{"text":"1989 is a big shock to\nthe system and suddenly,","offset":1346},{"text":"we have, for instance, in Western Europe,","offset":1351},{"text":"in Eastern Europe, the addition","offset":1353},{"text":"of a whole lot of new\nparliamentary democracies.","offset":1356},{"text":"That creates possibilities of thinking","offset":1360},{"text":"about long-established\nconventional wisdom,","offset":1364},{"text":"testing theories against new data","offset":1367},{"text":"which is the gold standard\nfor social science","offset":1371},{"text":"rather than testing theories on data","offset":1374},{"text":"out of which the theories\nhave been developed,","offset":1377},{"text":"which tend to result in\nwhat statisticians call","offset":1380},{"text":"just-so stories, fitting\nthe curve to the data.","offset":1384},{"text":"Suddenly we have all this new data,","offset":1388},{"text":"coming along in real time.","offset":1391},{"text":"If you think about and\nwe&amp;#39;re gonna talk some about","offset":1394},{"text":"some of the standard\ntheories in political science","offset":1397},{"text":"like modernization\ntheory, which is a theory","offset":1400},{"text":"about how as economies modify,","offset":1404},{"text":"certain kinds of political\nchanges become more likely.","offset":1408},{"text":"It was long held that\nmodernization produces democracy.","offset":1413},{"text":"There were many variants\nof modernization theory.","offset":1417},{"text":"And we will talk about some\nof the differences among them","offset":1420},{"text":"but now we have new data and\nwhether modernizing economies","offset":1424},{"text":"will produce democracy.","offset":1428},{"text":"It is long been conventional\nwisdom that democratic systems","offset":1431},{"text":"are incompatible with state-run economies.","offset":1435},{"text":"If we look at what&amp;#39;s happened since 1989,","offset":1439},{"text":"we&amp;#39;ve gone to market economies","offset":1443},{"text":"in some of the post-communist\nsystems but others","offset":1445},{"text":"like China and Vietnam have\nbecome state capitalist systems","offset":1448},{"text":"of a certain kind while retaining\nnon democratic politics.","offset":1456},{"text":"So we&amp;#39;ll have cause to\nthink about theories","offset":1461},{"text":"of that general sort.","offset":1464},{"text":"There&amp;#39;s been a lot of conventional wisdom","offset":1467},{"text":"about the conditions for stable democracy","offset":1470},{"text":"that suddenly can be put to the test","offset":1474},{"text":"on a whole slew of new democracies.","offset":1476},{"text":"Is it all the economy stupid","offset":1479},{"text":"or do beliefs of citizens matter?","offset":1481},{"text":"And what kinds of beliefs matter","offset":1485},{"text":"and what about the beliefs of elites?","offset":1488},{"text":"All of these things, we can look at again,","offset":1491},{"text":"in new contexts.","offset":1494},{"text":"So we have lots of new\ndata to think about them,","offset":1496},{"text":"provided by this dramatic break of 1989.","offset":1499},{"text":"There&amp;#39;s a lot of conventional wisdom","offset":1507},{"text":"about the relations between\nbusiness, government","offset":1509},{"text":"and labor that has built up\namong political economists","offset":1512},{"text":"and political scientists\nover the last several decades","offset":1516},{"text":"before 1989.","offset":1520},{"text":"We now have big power shifts\npartly because communism","offset":1522},{"text":"as an economic system has\nbeen taken off the table.","offset":1528},{"text":"Well if communism, as an economic system,","offset":1532},{"text":"is taken off the table, how\ndoes that restructure relations","offset":1534},{"text":"between business government and labor?","offset":1539},{"text":"It turns out it really has a big impact","offset":1543},{"text":"on those relationships.","offset":1546},{"text":"So that&amp;#39;s another of the\ntopics we will be looking at.","offset":1548},{"text":"How do electoral systems\naffect things like inequality,","offset":1554},{"text":"provision of environmental legislation","offset":1558},{"text":"and public goods?","offset":1562},{"text":"A lot of conventional wisdom there","offset":1564},{"text":"about which types of\ndemocracies are more likely","offset":1566},{"text":"to do that and which are\nless likely to do that","offset":1570},{"text":"start to look before and after 1989","offset":1573},{"text":"and we&amp;#39;re gonna discover","offset":1578},{"text":"that some of the conventional\nwisdom needs rethinking.","offset":1580},{"text":"So on the one hand\nwe&amp;#39;re bringing the tools","offset":1585},{"text":"of political science and the\ntheories of political science","offset":1590},{"text":"to bear on the data that&amp;#39;s thrown up","offset":1593},{"text":"by this last 30 years of history.","offset":1595},{"text":"On the other hand, we&amp;#39;re using that data","offset":1599},{"text":"to keep the political scientists honest,","offset":1603},{"text":"precisely because we have\nthis whole smorgasbord","offset":1607},{"text":"of new results as a social\nscientist would put it","offset":1615},{"text":"but then I also said\nI&amp;#39;m gonna use the tools","offset":1619},{"text":"of political theory.","offset":1622},{"text":"So political theory, I should\nconfess, truth in advertising","offset":1625},{"text":"by my first profession, if\nextended is a profession","offset":1629},{"text":"is I&amp;#39;m a political theorist.","offset":1638},{"text":"I cut my teeth in the world\nof political philosophy.","offset":1639},{"text":"I&amp;#39;m in normative things\nabout what should happen,","offset":1645},{"text":"how the world should be organized,","offset":1647},{"text":"rather than empirical work\non how it is organized.","offset":1649},{"text":"We are definitely gonna be thinking","offset":1657},{"text":"about normative questions\nhere as well as we go along,","offset":1659},{"text":"what should happen,\nwhat might have happened","offset":1663},{"text":"but the confession I need to\nmake about my home discipline","offset":1666},{"text":"is that it reminds me of\nthe story about the fella","offset":1671},{"text":"who goes up to a farmer in Donegal","offset":1676},{"text":"and says how do I get to Dublin","offset":1679},{"text":"and the answer that comes back is well,","offset":1682},{"text":"I wouldn&amp;#39;t start from here, sonny.","offset":1685},{"text":"That is to say much of\npolitical philosophy","offset":1689},{"text":"develops theories that take no account","offset":1693},{"text":"of where we actually\nare and how the theories","offset":1698},{"text":"that people argue about in the journals","offset":1702},{"text":"and in the literature\nactually could be implemented","offset":1705},{"text":"in the world, if at all.","offset":1707},{"text":"And this spills over\ninto normative arguments","offset":1709},{"text":"made by other scholars.","offset":1712},{"text":"Thomas Piketty in his book,","offset":1715},{"text":"Capital in the Twenty-First Century,","offset":1719},{"text":"argues for a 4% global wealth tax.","offset":1721},{"text":"Well, good luck with that.","offset":1728},{"text":"Who&amp;#39;s gonna implement\na 4% global wealth tax.","offset":1730},{"text":"So when I think about normative questions,","offset":1734},{"text":"it&amp;#39;s gonna be from the perspective","offset":1739},{"text":"of how might the goals\nthat we think are desirable","offset":1742},{"text":"actually be achieved.","offset":1746},{"text":"I am going to spend, as we go along,","offset":1749},{"text":"through the different topics\nthat we&amp;#39;re gonna be discussing.","offset":1752},{"text":"I am gonna be focusing on paths not taken,","offset":1757},{"text":"things that might have\nbeen done differently","offset":1760},{"text":"and here the sorts of things\nI&amp;#39;m gonna be talking about","offset":1763},{"text":"are things like NATO\nexpansion, after the collapse","offset":1768},{"text":"of the Soviet Union, the NATO alliance,","offset":1774},{"text":"we&amp;#39;ll talk about this next week","offset":1780},{"text":"which was expanded over\nthe next several decades","offset":1782},{"text":"to include most, eventually,","offset":1784},{"text":"all of the former Soviet bloc countries","offset":1786},{"text":"and there were overtures,","offset":1790},{"text":"also to including former\nSoviet states like Georgia and","offset":1791},{"text":"several others.","offset":1804},{"text":"I&amp;#39;ll, talk about this Ukraine,\nGeorgia and Ukraine were","offset":1806},{"text":"both talking about,\njoining NATO that part of","offset":1810},{"text":"the reason the Soviet\nUnion invaded Ukraine.","offset":1814},{"text":"So we will talk about\nwhether there was a path","offset":1820},{"text":"not taken at that time French\npresident Francois Mitterrand","offset":1822},{"text":"thought that NATO should be shut down","offset":1826},{"text":"at the end of the Cold War\nit was a defensive alliance","offset":1828},{"text":"that had lost its purpose.","offset":1831},{"text":"How realistic was that?","offset":1833},{"text":"how might the world have been\ndifferent had that happened","offset":1835},{"text":"we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about","offset":1839},{"text":"the Global War on Terror I","offset":1842},{"text":"should in after 9/11 when,","offset":1844},{"text":"we invaded first\nAfghanistan and then Iraq.","offset":1848},{"text":"Was there another path","offset":1852},{"text":"that would have been politically\nviable that would have led","offset":1854},{"text":"the world in a different direction.","offset":1857},{"text":"We will talk about the response to","offset":1861},{"text":"the financial crisis\nof 2008 in 2009, again","offset":1863},{"text":"what were their possibilities that,","offset":1867},{"text":"were, ignored or overlooked\nthat might have been","offset":1870},{"text":"both politically feasible\nand more polished effective","offset":1876},{"text":"in the sense of policy\nand so that brings me","offset":1882},{"text":"to underscore the third feature of","offset":1885},{"text":"the approach that I am\ngoing to take in this","offset":1888},{"text":"course which is when you look at, people","offset":1892},{"text":"who talk about public policy,","offset":1894},{"text":"it tends either to be\npolicy wonks who just go on","offset":1897},{"text":"about what would be, the best policy","offset":1901},{"text":"or political scientists who talk about","offset":1904},{"text":"why some policies get adopted in some","offset":1906},{"text":"systems and not in other systems","offset":1908},{"text":"but there&amp;#39;s very little discussion of what","offset":1911},{"text":"is the effective political way of","offset":1915},{"text":"achieving a good policy or","offset":1918},{"text":"the effective political way of blocking","offset":1920},{"text":"a bad policy and so when I\ntalk about innovations in","offset":1923},{"text":"the last part of the\ncourse, it&amp;#39;s very much going","offset":1928},{"text":"to be in a way that marries considerations","offset":1932},{"text":"of politics to considerations\nof good public policy","offset":1934},{"text":"so, that that is the flavor","offset":1941},{"text":"of what we&amp;#39;re going to be doing here","offset":1944},{"text":"and as I said it&amp;#39;s not the\nonly way one might study","offset":1947},{"text":"these materials ,but it&amp;#39;s\nthe way that we&amp;#39;re going","offset":1952},{"text":"to be doing it in this course.","offset":1955},{"text":"Let me talk a little bit\nabout the shape of the course.","offset":1958},{"text":"It falls into five, sections.","offset":1962},{"text":"The the first one is going to starting","offset":1965},{"text":"on Monday deal with the\ncollapse of communism","offset":1968},{"text":"and its aftermath.","offset":1971},{"text":"There we going to look\nat collapse of communism","offset":1974},{"text":"in Eastern Europe in Russia,","offset":1978},{"text":"in China and in Vietnam.\nAlthough I will talk","offset":1981},{"text":"about some other countries along the way.","offset":1985},{"text":"We&amp;#39;re going to talk about\nthe rise of a unipolar world,","offset":1989},{"text":"until 1989, we had a\nbipolar world in which,","offset":1993},{"text":"as I said a lot of actual stability,","offset":1998},{"text":"that came about as a\nbyproduct of the Cold War","offset":2001},{"text":"at least among the the major powers","offset":2002},{"text":"even if they maintained this stability,","offset":2006},{"text":"partly by, acting out their conflicts","offset":2010},{"text":"in proxy wars in, Asia, Africa and","offset":2014},{"text":"at America but it by and large","offset":2019},{"text":"the great powers were the\nnucleus standoff worked","offset":2021},{"text":"and we didn&amp;#39;t have a major\nconflict between them.","offset":2027},{"text":"Now we have gone to a\nunipolar world dominated,","offset":2031},{"text":"by a single power ,after 1989.","offset":2035},{"text":"How does that restructure politics and","offset":2039},{"text":"the possibilities for\npolitics that will be","offset":2042},{"text":"also part of our concern.","offset":2045},{"text":"And then I&amp;#39;m going to\ntalk about the, politics","offset":2048},{"text":"of the economics.","offset":2051},{"text":"What I&amp;#39;m going to call the\nrise of neoliberalism at home","offset":2056},{"text":"and the Washington Consensus abroad","offset":2060},{"text":"and this is put on this is basically","offset":2063},{"text":"it comes to, exist because of","offset":2067},{"text":"the collapse of an\nalternative to capitalism,","offset":2072},{"text":"the disappearance of communism\nas a viable, political system","offset":2075},{"text":"as a viable economic system and so you","offset":2080},{"text":"have this idea that&amp;#39;s\noften called neoliberalism","offset":2084},{"text":"that basically has three elements.","offset":2087},{"text":"Its trade deregulation,\ntrade deals getting rid","offset":2090},{"text":"of restraints on trade, getting\nrid of internal regulation","offset":2093},{"text":"within countries, and\nmassive privatization","offset":2098},{"text":"of formerly state assets","offset":2101},{"text":"that was called, the neoliberal approach","offset":2103},{"text":"to political public political economy.","offset":2106},{"text":"And when it&amp;#39;s translated into a set","offset":2112},{"text":"of recommendations or requirements","offset":2116},{"text":"for countries in the developing world,","offset":2119},{"text":"it was called the Washington Consensus,","offset":2121},{"text":"was essentially adopted by the World Bank","offset":2123},{"text":"by the IMF as a condition for giving loans","offset":2126},{"text":"to developing countries and it,","offset":2129},{"text":"was essentially taking\nneoliberalism global.","offset":2133},{"text":"And so the, post communist era is marked","offset":2138},{"text":"by, this massive confidence in, the","offset":2143},{"text":"the capacity of unregulated","offset":2151},{"text":"or mildly regulated\nfree-market capitalism,","offset":2154},{"text":"to deliver the best results,\nfor every country in","offset":2158},{"text":"the world then we&amp;#39;re going to talk about","offset":2163},{"text":"the new global order, that\nis ushered in by this.","offset":2167},{"text":"We&amp;#39;re going to look at\nwhether democracy really","offset":2170},{"text":"was on the march the people thought","offset":2175},{"text":"about a potential we had talked again","offset":2177},{"text":"the conventional wisdom in\npolitical science was that","offset":2180},{"text":"the democratization had\npreceded in three waves.","offset":2184},{"text":"The first wave being\nthe gradual expansion of","offset":2187},{"text":"the franchise in what we think of today as","offset":2192},{"text":"the older democracies,","offset":2194},{"text":"the second wave being decolonization in","offset":2195},{"text":"Africa and Asia and Latin\nAmerica after World War II.","offset":2198},{"text":"The third wave coming in 1989 to 1991","offset":2203},{"text":"and people started to\nwonder whether there&amp;#39;s","offset":2209},{"text":"a fourth wave now with\ndemocratization of South Africa","offset":2211},{"text":"with settlements in places\nlike Northern Ireland,","offset":2215},{"text":"initially with the Arab\nSpring people wondered whether","offset":2220},{"text":"we were going to start to\nsee more democracy as part of","offset":2224},{"text":"this new global order.","offset":2227},{"text":"Then we&amp;#39;re going to look at\nthe international institutions","offset":2231},{"text":"that developed in this global order,","offset":2236},{"text":"we&amp;#39;ll talk about things like,","offset":2239},{"text":"the International Criminal Court","offset":2241},{"text":"which for the first time would\nhold dictators to account","offset":2243},{"text":"for their activities of repression.","offset":2248},{"text":"There was the creation and of\nsomething called a doctrine","offset":2253},{"text":"at the United Nations called\nthe responsibility to protect.","offset":2256},{"text":"Responsibility to protect, says that this","offset":2260},{"text":"was in the wake of, things\nlike the Rwanda genocide","offset":2263},{"text":"of 1994 and what happened in\nKosovo, in 1999 eventually","offset":2272},{"text":"we got responsibility\nto protect where the UN","offset":2278},{"text":"was said all governments are going to","offset":2281},{"text":"be held accountable for\nsevere human rights violations","offset":2283},{"text":"within their own territories\nand if they don&amp;#39;t respect them,","offset":2288},{"text":"the UN is going to intervene,\nmilitarily this is you know a","offset":2296},{"text":"big change we&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re not going","offset":2300},{"text":"to respect the sovereignty of Nations","offset":2303},{"text":"so the new international\norder seems to be,","offset":2306},{"text":"affecting not only\nrelations among countries","offset":2312},{"text":"but relations within them.","offset":2315},{"text":"The third part of the course I&amp;#39;m calling","offset":2319},{"text":"the end of the end of\nhistory and this is really,","offset":2321},{"text":"has its ultimate roots with 9/11","offset":2328},{"text":"and the emergence of the\nglobal war on terror.","offset":2330},{"text":"The invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya","offset":2335},{"text":"and eventually the collapsing Syria","offset":2338},{"text":"we&amp;#39;re going to see that\nthe idea that history","offset":2343},{"text":"was heading in some benign direction,","offset":2347},{"text":"was getting harder and harder\nfor people to hold on to.","offset":2351},{"text":"we&amp;#39;re going to look at the\nresurgence of state capitalism.","offset":2357},{"text":"we&amp;#39;re going to look at\nwhat China was, has been","offset":2364},{"text":"and is doing in Africa.","offset":2368},{"text":"We are going to be looking\nat Russia&amp;#39;s resurgence","offset":2370},{"text":"as a global power, they had\nbeen back on their heels,","offset":2375},{"text":"for much of the 1990s and early 2000","offset":2378},{"text":"but now they became actively\ninvolved, in, the Middle East","offset":2382},{"text":"and elsewhere, we&amp;#39;re going to, look at,","offset":2387},{"text":"the new role of business in\nmany political conflicts around","offset":2392},{"text":"the world sometimes with\nbenign purposes in mind,","offset":2398},{"text":"but often not and so we&amp;#39;re\ngoing to start to see","offset":2402},{"text":"a much messier politics.","offset":2405},{"text":"The fourth part of the course, is about","offset":2408},{"text":"the new politics of insecurity.","offset":2411},{"text":"This is really ushered in not so much by","offset":2414},{"text":"the financial crisis\nitself, but by the way","offset":2417},{"text":"in which governments responded\nto the financial crisis","offset":2421},{"text":"and this will be one of the areas","offset":2425},{"text":"where we will be looking\nat paths not taken but,","offset":2426},{"text":"we will see that there\nwas, growing insecurity","offset":2430},{"text":"in the workforces of many\nof the advanced democracies","offset":2437},{"text":"that had been building up for decades,","offset":2441},{"text":"and the financial crisis,","offset":2445},{"text":"threw into sharp relief","offset":2451},{"text":"the fact that most governments\nwere not doing much","offset":2453},{"text":"about it if anything at all","offset":2456},{"text":"and in fact that they ended\nup bailing out the elites,","offset":2459},{"text":"while doing nothing much,","offset":2463},{"text":"for the people who have been\nmost harmed in the crisis","offset":2466},{"text":"and so we will look at the response to,","offset":2470},{"text":"the financial crisis","offset":2473},{"text":"in a number of countries\nparticularly in the US","offset":2475},{"text":"and then we will all in the\nlast part of the course,","offset":2481},{"text":"what is to be done that\ngreat Leninists slogan,","offset":2486},{"text":"we will be looking at, two things really.","offset":2490},{"text":"First how the, voter sentiment in","offset":2494},{"text":"these countries was,\nso poorly misdiagnosed","offset":2499},{"text":"by so many, political elites","offset":2504},{"text":"and people in control of\npolitical parties, misdiagnosed","offset":2507},{"text":"to the point where not only\ndid they fail to respond,","offset":2511},{"text":"to the growing economic insecurity,","offset":2514},{"text":"that was experienced by many,\nmany millions of workers","offset":2517},{"text":"within their own countries.","offset":2523},{"text":"They were actually\nimplementing political reforms","offset":2525},{"text":"that were likely to make things worse.","offset":2528},{"text":"And so the last part of the\ncourse will be looking at","offset":2532},{"text":"those two interacting issues.","offset":2536},{"text":"What sorts of economic\npolicies were pursued","offset":2539},{"text":"or failed to be pursued.","offset":2542},{"text":"What kinds of policies\nmight have been pursued","offset":2545},{"text":"and how did the reform\nof political systems over","offset":2548},{"text":"the last 15 or 20 years,","offset":2552},{"text":"make the problem worse\nand that will lead me,","offset":2556},{"text":"to make some arguments, about\nhow we should, think about,","offset":2559},{"text":"politics going forward.","offset":2563},{"text":"So, that is what we&amp;#39;re going, to be doing.","offset":2568},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s a big menu, we have, you know","offset":2571},{"text":"we have 26 now soon to be 25 lectures in","offset":2574},{"text":"which to explore it.","offset":2579},{"text":"I&amp;#39;m going to, before breaking today,","offset":2582},{"text":"I&amp;#39;m going to talk about\na few logistical matters.","offset":2586},{"text":"One is that I have been\nasked to announce but","offset":2590},{"text":"you can see for yourself,","offset":2592},{"text":"that the Office of Public Affairs is,","offset":2596},{"text":"taking pictures and\nthese lectures are going","offset":2598},{"text":"to be videotaped.","offset":2603},{"text":"And this will include, we\nwill have microphones so we","offset":2605},{"text":"can have questions from\nthe floor and interaction","offset":2609},{"text":"but you should know that,","offset":2615},{"text":"this is all being tape recorded and","offset":2617},{"text":"so anything you say can be taken down","offset":2620},{"text":"and used in evidence against you.","offset":2622},{"text":"So, a couple of other logistical things.","offset":2626},{"text":"One is I want to introduce\nChristina Seyfreid.","offset":2631},{"text":"Christina, she&amp;#39;s the head teaching fellow","offset":2634},{"text":"for the course so for\nshe will be overseeing","offset":2638},{"text":"the grading of students\nwho are taking the course,","offset":2642},{"text":"for, credit and she will\nalso be working with me,","offset":2645},{"text":"in, running office hours for\npeople from the community,","offset":2651},{"text":"which we&amp;#39;re both going to be doing.","offset":2656},{"text":"I&amp;#39;ll say a little bit more about","offset":2659},{"text":"that in a minute but, you will see more","offset":2661},{"text":"of Christina as we go along.","offset":2663},{"text":"Office hours I&amp;#39;m gonna be having","offset":2668},{"text":"office hours in Rosenkranz room 201","offset":2671},{"text":"from 10:00 to 12:00 on\nWednesdays and Fridays.","offset":2675},{"text":"The presumption there is that","offset":2678},{"text":"from 10:00 to 12:00, Yale\nstudents have priority.","offset":2680},{"text":"These are walk-in office\nhours not by appointment","offset":2685},{"text":"and on 10:00 to 12:00\non Fridays, people from","offset":2687},{"text":"the community have priority but who knows","offset":2690},{"text":"if anyone will show up but\nthat&amp;#39;s the way it&amp;#39;ll work","offset":2693},{"text":"201 Rosenkranz Hall\nwhich is right opposite,","offset":2698},{"text":"the new colleges up the street.","offset":2702},{"text":"Christina is going to have office hours","offset":2706},{"text":"for people from the\ncommunity on

of you have\nalready bought plane tickets","offset":2826},{"text":"that are, inconsistent with that.","offset":2829},{"text":"So actually we&amp;#39;re going to\nhave to alternate

exam period","offset":2843},{"text":"and that exam will, if we can arrange it","offset":2847},{"text":"be held at SOM, and then there&amp;#39;ll be,","offset":2850},{"text":"but others can take

couple of years ago.","offset":2878},{"text":"It definitely works better.","offset":2881},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s just too tempting to be\ndoing that Amazon shopping","offset":2883},{"text":"for your grandmother&amp;#39;s birthday present","offset":2887},{"text":"that you forgot about\nand it&amp;#39;s very distracting","offset":2890},{"text":"not only for the people\naround you but it&amp;#39;s","offset":2897},{"text":"also distracting for me, to teach.","offset":2900},{"text":"We will post the slides on Canvas and on","offset":2905},{"text":"the course web page off the lectures","offset":2910},{"text":"so people will have access, to the slides.","offset":2912},{"text":"What you&amp;#39;ll find is if\nyou go and you look at","offset":2916},{"text":"the slides on Canvas,","offset":2918},{"text":"they&amp;#39;ll look like they&amp;#39;d\nbeen turned into a PDF","offset":2922},{"text":"and the video will not play.","offset":2924},{"text":"If you want to play the\nvideo, you have to download","offset":2927},{"text":"the slides and then it will\nread, it will regurgitate","offset":2929},{"text":"as playable videos,","offset":2934},{"text":"so it is possible to play the video,","offset":2935},{"text":"yes so no laptops, no screens, no phones","offset":2941},{"text":"and everything, everything I\nput up here will be available","offset":2948},{"text":"to

can&amp;#39;t.","offset":2986},{"text":"So that&amp;#39;s why we put a\nset of the reasonings","offset":2987},{"text":"in a New Haven library\nand the reason for it,","offset":2989},{"text":"it&amp;#39;s not just Yale being mean.","offset":2992},{"text":"It turns out there&amp;#39;re two\nsets of copyright rules","offset":2995},{"text":"so if you are photocopying\nchapters from a book,","offset":2998},{"text":"you are allowed to take\nup to 10% of the book,","offset":3006},{"text":"otherwise you have to buy the book","offset":3010},{"text":"if you&amp;#39;re using it but\nuniversities, for their students,","offset":3011},{"text":"have a more permissive rule.","offset":3016},{"text":"So we can take more than 10% from a book.","offset":3018},{"text":"I&amp;#39;ve forgotten what the exact number is","offset":3021},{"text":"but it&amp;#39;s much more than 10%.","offset":3023},{"text":"We can take more than 10% from a book","offset":3024},{"text":"and put it up on Canvas\nif it&amp;#39;s only available","offset":3027},{"text":"to Yale students but if\nwe made them available","offset":3031},{"text":"to the general public,","offset":3035},{"text":"Yale would be violating copyright laws.","offset":3037},{"text":"So that&amp;#39;s why we have bought\ntwo complete sets of the books","offset":3040},{"text":"and put them in a New\nHaven Public Library,","offset":3044},{"text":"from which we have been\nxeroxing most of this stuff.","offset":3047},{"text":"So you should be able\nto get the vast majority","offset":3050},{"text":"of the readings if you wanna go down there","offset":3054},{"text":"and get them.","offset":3056},{"text":"Other questions, comments, observations?","offset":3064},{"text":"If there&amp;#39;s a question in your mind,","offset":3067},{"text":"it&amp;#39;s probably in the\nmind of 30 other people","offset":3068},{"text":"so they&amp;#39;ll be grateful if you ask it.","offset":3070},{"text":"Yeah, you just have to yell.","offset":3072},{"text":"(student speaking faintly)","offset":3075},{"text":"Are we gonna look at the\nEuropean Union as well as what?","offset":3080},{"text":"(student speaking faintly)","offset":3083},{"text":"We&amp;#39;re certainly gonna look at the growth","offset":3091},{"text":"of the European Union and the expansion","offset":3093},{"text":"of the European Union since, in fact,","offset":3096},{"text":"we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about it next class.","offset":3098},{"text":"We&amp;#39;re gonna look at the\nexpansion of the European Union","offset":3102},{"text":"since the Cold War.","offset":3106},{"text":"I&amp;#39;ll talk very briefly about the early,","offset":3108},{"text":"this course is really post 1989.","offset":3111},{"text":"We&amp;#39;ve just hired David\nEngerman and Arne Westad,","offset":3116},{"text":"who are both cold war historians","offset":3120},{"text":"who are gonna be teaching\ncourses on the Cold War.","offset":3122},{"text":"So if you really wanna deal\nwith the post-war Europe","offset":3125},{"text":"from into war Europe II to\nthe end of the Cold War,","offset":3130},{"text":"these are the guys who\nare gonna be teaching","offset":3137},{"text":"that stuff going forward in Yale College.","offset":3139},{"text":"So I&amp;#39;m very consciously not doing that.","offset":3142},{"text":"So I will talk about the way\nin which the European Union","offset":3146},{"text":"was formed which has had a lot to do","offset":3152},{"text":"with its current troubles but mostly,","offset":3155},{"text":"I&amp;#39;m gonna focus on since 1989.","offset":3157},{"text":"Yeah, pardon?","offset":3160},{"text":"(student speaking faintly)","offset":3164},{"text":"There are no sections in this course.","offset":3165},{"text":"This is why we have an\nhour and a quarter lecture","offset":3167},{"text":"rather than a 50-minute lecture.","offset":3169},{"text":"Yeah.","offset":3172},{"text":"(student speaking faintly)","offset":3173},{"text":"The topics for the papers\nwill be posted two weeks","offset":3176},{"text":"before the papers are\ndue and we will give,","offset":3180},{"text":"I should say a couple\nof things about that.","offset":3184},{"text":"This is not a research course","offset":3187},{"text":"so you can write a first-rate\npaper based on reading","offset":3189},{"text":"the material on this syllabus.","offset":3194},{"text":"You are not expected to\ngo beyond the syllabus.","offset":3196},{"text":"And we will post, two weeks\nbefore the papers are due,","offset":3201},{"text":"a list of topics of and it will be,","offset":3206},{"text":"there will be very significant\namount of choice on it","offset":3211},{"text":"so we&amp;#39;ll probably give you\nfour or five possible topics","offset":3215},{"text":"to write about.","offset":3219},{"text":"Yes, sir.","offset":3221},{"text":"What is the expectation\nfor graduate students?","offset":3224},{"text":"The same course requirements,\ntwo papers and a final exam.","offset":3229},{"text":"Yeah.","offset":3235},{"text":"Yes, sir.","offset":3238},{"text":"Pardon.","offset":3241},{"text":"- [Student] Is there a\nlimit

there will be questions.","offset":3284},{"text":"I&amp;#39;m not planning to talk\nfor an hour and a quarter","offset":3287},{"text":"every Tuesday and Thursday.","offset":3289},{"text":"So there will be significant\namount of interaction.","offset":3292},{"text":"Yes sir.","offset":3298},{"text":"(student speaking faintly)","offset":3300},{"text":"Yeah, we currently, I believe, have six","offset":3303},{"text":"in addition to Christina&amp;#39;s\nTeaching Fellows,","offset":3307},{"text":"all of whom will be holding office hours.","offset":3310},{"text":"They&amp;#39;ll be
